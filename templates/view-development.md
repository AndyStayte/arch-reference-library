## Module Structure Models

### Modularisation Approach

<_For each language used explain how modularisation of the application will be achieved._>

<!--
For example:
- Java: packages & JARs
- JavaScript: global functions & Common.js
-->

### Resource Naming

<_For each language used (Java, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) describe the naming conventions that will be used for packages, files, methods, etc._>

### Module Organisation

<_Using UML produce one or more component diagrams that illustrate how the system's source code is organised into packages, modules, and application tiers / layers. If relevant define and document interlayer dependency rules. Provide one model for each application process (e.g. a client-server or micro-services architecture)._>


## Common Design Models

<_Document design constraints and common approaches that will apply when architecting and realising the system._>

### Common Design Model: <_Element Name_>

#### Design element

<_Describe the element of the solution for which a common approach is required (e.g. logging, internationalisation or database access)._>

#### Agreed approach
<_Describe the standard approach that has been agreed for the design element. Also include an explanation of where this approach is applicable and why it is the preferred approach. If necessary include one or more UML diagrams to illustrate the approach._>

#### Technology solution

<_Describe any third-party software or libraries that will form part of the solution_>.


## Code-line Models

<_Summarise the development practices that you will use to ensure a predictable, sustainable & adaptive delivery process._>

### Release Management

<_Describe how the software will be built, components integrated, and how formal releases with stable version numbers will be generated._>

### Asset and Configuration Management

<_Explain how source code and other assets will be version controlled, how configuration and software dependencies will be managed and how binary assets will stored in a definitive media library._>

### Test Approach

<_Describe the test approach or refer to an existing test strategy that will be followed._>

<!--
Include details of:
- Exploratory tests
- Continuous Integration
- Integration tests
- Unit tests
- Customer tests
-->

### Quality Approach

<_Describe the quality approach or refer to an existing quality strategy that will be followed._>

<!--
Practices should include:
- Cross-functional teams
- Co-location
- Information radiators
- Pair programming
- Definition of Done
- Collective code ownership
- Simple design
- Coding standards
- Spikes
- Refactoring
- Code review
- Ubiquitous Language
- Retrospectives
- Static Analysis
-->

### Deliverables

#### Applications

<_Provide details of the binaries that will be produced._>

#### Documentation

<_Describe how documentation will be produced._>

#### Other

<_Provide details of any other artefacts that will be produced._>

### Dependencies

<_Provide details of external deliverables, work-streams or organisations upon which implementation will depend._>

### Metrics & Measurement

<_Specify the targets for each dev metric and how it will be measured._>

### Reporting

<_Describe how dev activity will be reported to the rest of the program team._>

### Intellectual Property

<_Describe how IPR will be managed: license acceptance, review frequency, etc._>

### Tooling

<_Describe the tooling that will be used._>
