### SWAN

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The Scottish Wide Area Network (SWAN) is a single public services network for the use of all public service organisations within Scotland.

As a priority action of Scotland’s Digital Future: Delivery of Public Services, SWAN is a means by which the public services delivery sector can collaborate across organisational boundaries to ensure that the services delivered – whether at national or local level – can be truly joined up to meet the needs of the users of public services, the citizens and businesses of Scotland.

The SWAN initiative aims to enable infrastructure and service sharing that will produce cost and performance efficiencies and facilitate the creation of public services that are high quality, continually improving, efficient and responsive to local needs.

### mygov.scot

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Application
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The mygov.scot service provides citizens and businesses with quick and simple access to Scottish Government services. mygov.scot currently provides access to information about services, and is phasing in support for online tools and transactions.

The service provides significant benefits for citizens and businesses:

- All government services can be found from one place;
- Users don’t have to know which organisation is responsible for service;
- Better service information that is task-orientated and presented in plain English;
- Works consistently across phones, tablets or computers.

The benefits for government are:

- Reduces costs by removing separate websites and publishing systems;
- Easy to pick up and use immediately without specialist training;
- Templated formats and editorial controls support consistency and quality;
- Designed to improve iteratively and often, keeping pace with change.

mygov.scot is a platform that allows Scottish public sector organisations to publish information about their services. It is a modern solution that has been designed specifically for the content management and publishing needs of the Scottish public sector. The service is actively supported and continuously improved based on user's needs.

The mygov.scot Content Design team provides central editorial governance and support for publishers. They work in partnership with Scottish public sector organisations to ensure that published content meets a real user need and follows the mygov.scot style guide. However, the ownership of the information still remains with the organisation, as the subject matter expert.

Public sector organisations can access the mygov.scot service by emailing the [content updates](mailto:contentupdates@gov.scot) mailbox.

### myaccount

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Application
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

[Scotland’s Digital Future: Delivery of Public Services](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2012/09/6272) sets out a need for a common approach to sign-in. The Scottish Government approach has been developed in partnership with the Scottish public sector. myaccount is the agreed approach. myaccount gives people across Scotland a secure and easy way to access online public services.

- When people undertake a transaction online they want to be confident it is secure and their identities are protected while organisations need to know who they are transacting with. myaccount provides this.
- myaccount is live and available for immediate use by local authorities and health boards.
- Having a single solution avoids the need for each provider to invest, develop or buy their own sign-in solution.
- In addition to sign-in, myaccount further offers public sector organisations data, verification and notification services. These are data management services - providing tools to improve the quality and accuracy of their own local data, a verification service – a set of tools and business processes which validate and verify individuals and a notification service - to advise of change of circumstances for registered users.
- myaccount is centrally funded through support Scottish Government gives to the Improvement Service in relation to delivery of public services.

### Public Sector Colocation Register

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The Scottish Government provides a [colocation register](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/datahostingdatacentres/pscoloregister) as a part of its activities to support Scottish public sector organisations in realising the [Data Hosting and Data Centre Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/datahostingdatacentres). The register lists public sector organisations who offer colocation services for data hosting.

### Device Lab

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The Scottish Government's Digital Public Services and Business Transformation Division (DPS&BT) maintains and operates a device lab for testing web sites, web applications and mobile applications. The lab contains over 40 physical devices including smartphones, tablets, consoles and e-readers and is available for use by other Scottish public sector organisations and programmes. The lab is based in The Scottish Government's Victoria Quay office in Edinburgh.

The device lab has been created in order to support Scottish public sector organisations in delivering against the [High Level Operating Framework's](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/HLOF) Multi-Channel principle (OFP-CC2).

Testing should be agreed and scheduled with the DPS&BT division. This can be done by emailing the [Device Lab Enquiries](mailto:devicelab@gov.scot) mailbox. The primary contact will be expected to supply details in advance for all persons attending for the duration of testing. If the persons conducting the testing do not have Scottish Government security passes, appropriate arrangements can be made.

A full list of devices is available upon request.

### The One Scotland Gazetteer

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Data
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The One Scotland Gazetteer is an address database made up of all 32 individual local authority gazetteers. Key features include:

- Spatially referenced address records;
- Property lifecycle details;
- Full compliance to the Scottish Gazetteer Conventions.

Addresses are created in accordance with the national standard for addressing, BS7666:2006 and the Scottish Gazetteer Conventions. All 32 Scottish local authorities are responsible for their local Street Naming and Numbering function, allowing them to add, edit and remove records when appropriate. Further address information is gathered through planning applications and building warrant completions, showing when new properties are being created and old ones are being demolished. This brings a high level of currency and accuracy to the One Scotland Gazetteer.

The One Scotland Gazetteer may be accessed in two different formats, either through a web service or as a CSV export.  The most suitable option will depend on which best suits your requirements.

One Scotland Gazetteer data is available to any organisation that is a member of the One Scotland Mapping Agreement.

### PSN

The [PSN](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/public-services-network) is the UK government’s high-performance network, which helps public sector organisations work together, reduce duplication and share resources.

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | UK public sector

The Public Services Network (PSN) is a multi-supplier environment providing end-to-end service assurance for security, integrity and reliability, comprising a network of networks operating at a minimum Business Impact Level of IL2 for Confidentiality and Integrity. The PSN in effect offers the benefits of a competitive multi-vendor market place, but with levels of performance and assurance typically associated with a single-supplier network. PSN suppliers must comply with standards to ensure that this integrity is maintained.

Public sector organisations can access PSN-compliant services over the PSN. A [catalogue of PSN-compliant services](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-services-network-psn-service-compliance) is available, which lists the services currently available and the services in the process of becoming PSN-compliant. Commercial service providers can sell services to public sector organisations on the PSN, but the service must be PSN compliant.

### UK Verify

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Application
| **Scope**         | UK public sector

UK Verify is the UK Government's solution that allows citizens to prove who they are online. The service has been designed with the aim of giving citizens safer, simpler and faster access to government services.

When a citizen uses UK Verify to access a government service, they choose from a list of companies certified to verify their identity. Each certified company has different ways of verifying a citizen's identity. Service providers can be assured they’re providing their service to the right individual or business after matching an assured identity to their own records.

UK Verify is designed to be safe for citizens because information is not stored centrally, and there’s no unnecessary sharing of information. The company a citizen chooses doesn’t know which service they're trying to access, and the government department doesn’t know which company the citizen chose.

UK Verify is designed to support different 'levels of assurance' – the degree of confidence the service provider requires that a user is who they say they are. The levels are:

- **level 1**: the service needs to know that it is the same user returning to the service but does not need to know who that user is;
- **level 2**: the service needs to know on the balance of probabilities who the user is and that that they are a real person;
- **level 3**: the service needs to know beyond reasonable doubt who the user is and that that they are a real person;
- **level 4**: as for level 3, but with a biometric profile captured at the point of registration. This level is not within the scope of the current stage in the UK Verify programme.

### Crown Hosting Data Centres

| -                 | -
| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | UK public sector

Crown Hosting Data Centres is a joint venture between Her Majesty’s Government and Ark Data Centres. The [Crown Hosting Data Centres framework contract](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/crown-hosting) provides access to physical co-location data centre space for public sector legacy systems and is on the Digital Marketplace, with services available to call off immediately.

The [Scottish Government Data Hosting and Data Centre Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2014/04/1578) vision is that cloud services are the dominant solution for Scottish public sector organisations’ data hosting and storage requirements. However, in circumstances where a cloud or virtualisation approach is not possible, co-location solutions such as Crown Hosting Data Centres may be used in order for organisations to avoid building new data centres. Use of a co-location service should be seen as an interim measure enabling organisations to keep older systems running while they transition to cloud. However, for others, Crown Hosting provides a service where a cloud solution isn’t suitable for security reasons.

Crown Hosting Data Centres provides cost-effective hosting for the whole of the public sector, without tying departments into lengthy and expensive contracts. These services are open to any UK publicly funded, mandated, regulated and previously regulated organisations.

## Ongoing activities

### GDS: Government as a Platform

Government as a Platform is UK Government's new vision for digital government:

> common core infrastructure of shared digital systems, technology and processes on which it’s easy to build brilliant, user-centric government services.

GDS have identified that siloed approaches to transformation don’t work and that 'reinventing the wheel' every time the public sector builds a service has led to duplication and waste. Based on their investigations they believe that there are around thirty foundational capabilities that, if they existed and could be re-used, would radically change the speed and cost of building new services.

To test this GDS are building a range of common services that are used all around government. These services can then be interconnected to form larger systems or full services. GDS expects that with shared components delivering common capabilities, service teams can focus solely on building what their service needs to do. GDS also plans to build this component suite using open standards to ensure that it isn't closed or locked away inside a proprietary stack of technology and processes.

GDS believes that GAAP will make it quicker and cheaper to build new services meaning that citizens and businesses will get more services, of a higher quality, and for less money than before.

The following services are currently being developed as a a part of GAAP:

- [Gov.uk Pay](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/23/making-payments-more-convenient-and-efficient/)
- [Gov.uk Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify)
- [Gov.uk Notify](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/01/06/introducing-notify/)

In support of the GAAP GDS are also building a general purpose [platform to host digital services](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/08/building-a-platform-to-host-digital-services/) based on [Cloud Foundry](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/). The service is currently in [beta](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/24/hosting-digital-services-beta/).
