## Static Information Structure Models

<_Using UML produce one or more diagrams that illustrate the static structure of the information. Focus on the important data elements and the relationships between them. This will typically be based on an entity-relationship modelling approach._>


## Information Flow Models

<_Using SSADM data flow syntax produce one or more diagrams that illustrate the movement of information between elements of the system and the outside world. Include details such as the direction the information flows, the scope of the information transferred, the volume of data transferred and the means by which the transfer occurs._>


## Information Lifecycle Models

<_Using UML produce one or more state charts that illustrate how the values of key information entities change over time, from creation to deletion. Include the external events that cause changes in state._>


## Optional Models

### Information Ownership Models

<_If relevant, using text and tables, describe which systems own the most significant entities or attributes from your information structure models above. This can be elaborated into a trust and permissions model that explains which activities (CRUD, etc.) can be performed by which systems and, importantly, what conflict resolution strategies will be used in the case that more than one system can change an entity._>

### Information Quality Analysis

<_If relevant, using text and tables, capture the quality of data that can be expected from each data source. Where low quality data is expected specify the principles and practices that will be used to deal with low quality data._>

### Metadata Models

<_If relevant, specify using text and tables, any metadata, vocabularies or classifications that are relevant to the information architecture and explain how these will be used._>

### Volumetric Models

<_If relevant, specify using text and tables, the current and predicted volumes of data that are expected. In particular, focus on the most architecturally significant information structures and information flows._>
