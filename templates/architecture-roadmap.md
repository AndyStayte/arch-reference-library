# Architecture Roadmap


## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe, at a high level, the transitional steps that will be taken in order to progress from the baseline architecture that exists now to the target architecture, which will deliver the programme's stated benefits.

<_If possible, identify the major pieces of work that must be undertaken, the order in which those work items must be completed and the value that will be delivered at each increment._>

## Executive Summary

<_Summarise the document in 1 or 2 paragraphs._>


## Baseline Architecture

<_Provide a clear and unabiguous description of the system's current architecture. If available, this should include a link to the system's architecture description._>


## Target Architecture

<_Provide a clear and unambiguous description of the system architecture that you plan to realise. If available, this should include a link to the system's architecture description._>


## Gap Analysis

<_Compare the baseline and target architectures to identify any building blocks that are not yet in place, will require to be changed or will be redundant and can be eliminated._>

|                         | Target building block 1 |  Target building block 2 | Target building block 3 | Eliminate
| ---                      | ---                    | ---                      | ---
| **Baseline building block 0** | | | | Eliminate
| **Baseline building block 1** | Re-use 'as is'
| **Baseline building block 2** | | Re-use with changes
| **Acquire**               | | | Acquire

<_Catalogue the changes identified through gap analysis and begin to assess the potential solutions and dependencies. You can then use this catalogue as input into the planning of transitional architectures on the journey to the target architecture._>

## Transitional Stages

<_Provide a table that summarises the sequence of transitional architectures whose completion will realise the target architecture. If possible provide the dates at which transition architectures will be delivered._>

|                | Transition Arch 0 | Transition Arch 1 | Transition Arch …
| ---            | ---               | ---               | ---
| ** Project 0** | Solution a, …     | Solution b        | Solution …
| ** Project 1** | Solution c        |                   | Solution …
| ** Project …** |                   | Solution d, …     |
