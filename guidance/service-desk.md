# Service Desk 

To provide a high-quality service a dedicated team should be resourced to handle user enquiries, to help direct them to the information they want and to deal with problems. In order to resource this team a number of factors must be considered as detailed below. 


## Type and volume of contacts

The first consideration is to quantify the volume and type of contacts that you’ll receive for the service being supported. In some cases, historical data for similar services can be used as a baseline but, if this is an entirely new service, the business analysis done through Stakeholder engagement should provide guidance.

This element of planning will also need to take into account the contact channels to be supported (eg email, phone, chat, Twitter, Facebook, surface mail, etc). Ideally, each of these channels will have a separate contact forecast to aid your planning.

This part of the planning exercise will also be informed by or will itself drive decisions about the technology used to route, handle, and store data from these contacts.


## Service Levels

The Service Desk will be the Custodian of the Service Levels relating to incident responsiveness and resolution times in  the SLA. The SLA is likely to specify responsiveness targets, eg 95% of all phone enquiries will be answered within 15 seconds, all e-mail contacts will be responded to within 24 hours etc. Response times should not be confused with resolution times and  there are also likely to be service levels around resolution times for incidents raised. In considering resourcing, the extent to which calls can be resolved by Service Desk without referral to technical support teams will need to be assessed. Even though the Service Desk have passed a call to a support team for resolution they will still need to monitor and chase progress in addition to logging status, resolution and reporting.


## Escalation

The Service Desk should ensure that escalation levels specified in the SLA are enforced and the appropriate person(s) are informed of issues.


## Handling Time

If deep historical data is available, it may be possible to model the average handling time for each kind of contact. If not, then an estimate should be made using data from  the business analysis phase. It is essential that all contacts are logged timeously and accurately so that the actual handling times can be compared with estimates and adjustments can be made in either resourcing or service levels.

## Support Levels

The level of support provided by a Service Desk varies for different organizations. This can range from a basic call logging and allocation service to providing first line support before passing relatively few, complex, incidents to technical support teams. To maximize the benefit of a Service Desk, first line support should be performed. This will involve fixing simple problems and performing initial diagnosis, using scripts and processes provided by technical support teams where necessary. This will mean that calls are effectively filtered before being passed to technical support teams.


## Service Hours

The Service Desk hours of operation will also need to be established. This will be driven by the service profile of usage, either from historical data or the business analysis. This will need to be balanced against cost and the service level required. Potentially, support for a web service may be needed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It may be possible to determine a usage profile for the service which may identify periods where only out of hours support is needed in response to critical faults, and the front-line support provided by the Service Desk to handle enquiries is not required. This should be agreed in advance and monitored to ensure that forecasts were accurate, adjusting service hours, or service levels, as necessary.

## Resourcing

When all of the above factors have been assessed the resourcing requirements for the Service Desk can be determined. This may involve an element of shift working to ensure that the Service Desk is manned with sufficient staff at all times during the service hours to handle the anticipated volume of calls within the service levels.

## Monitoring

As mentioned above, it is critical to monitor the actual performance against Service Levels to ensure that changes over time are reflected through the varying of service levels or the resource profile.

## Reporting

Regular reporting of incidents and problems including call numbers and outcomes, response and resolution times, performance against service levels and breaches should be include as part of MI.
