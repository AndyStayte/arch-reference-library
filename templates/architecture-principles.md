# Architecture Principles: <_project name_>

These are the architecture priinciples for the <_project name_> project.

TOGAF defines architecture principles as follows:

> Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.
In their turn, principles may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively define and guide the organization, from values through to actions and results.

The purpose of this set of architecture principles is to provide architects with a framework for making good quality architecture design decisions that reflect the broader objectives and ambitions of our organisation.

## Considerations

<_Projects do not execute in a vacuum. Organisations will often have one or more existing sets of principles that are designed for the whole enterprise or segments of the enterprise. Use this section to explain how this set of principles derive from, vary or exclude principles from other principle sets. Also, where relevant, describe the relative priorities of principles or any resolution measures required where the implications of principles are incompatible._>
