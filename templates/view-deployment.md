## Runtime Platform Models

<_Using UML produce one or more deployment diagrams that illustrate the set of hardware nodes that are required, how they are connected via the network, and which software elements are hosted on which hardware nodes. Avoid providing too much detail regarding the network as this will likely make the diagram hard to understand._>


## Network Models

<_Using UML produce one or more deployment diagrams that illustrate the capabilities of the network required. You should include how nodes are connected, specific network services that are required (firewalls, UTMs, accelerators, etc.) as well as bandwidth and quality of service requirements._>


## Technology Dependency Models

<_Document the technology dependencies (including specific versions) for each node of your runtime platform model(s). If necessary record this information in a table. However, wherever possible you should aim to to reference executable specifications of your runtime environment such as Puppet manifests or Maven POM files._>
