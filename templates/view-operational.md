# Operational View: <_Project Name_>


## Purpose

> The operational view describes how the system will be operated, administered, and supported when it is running in its production environment.

Note that each of these models can be quite large and involved. When this is the case, it is sensible to summarise the model in the architecture description (AD) and reference a fuller model in another document, to avoid making the AD too large and unwieldy.

## Installation Model

<_Document, using text and tables, how the system will be moved from its development environment to its production environment._>


## Migration Model

<_Where an existing system exists, describe, using text and tables, what strategy will be used to migrate from the old system to the new system._>


## Configuration Management Models

<_Document, using text and tables, how system assets and configuration will be managed. Explain groups of configuration items, dependencies between those groups, and how a configuration is applied to system._>


## Administration Models

<_Define and document the operational requirements and constraints of your architecture and the facilities it provides for administrative users. This should include the following areas: monitoring and control facilities; required routine procedures; likely error conditions and performance monitoring facilities._>


## Support Models

<_Provide a clear abstraction of the support model that will be provided, who will provide the support, and how problems can be escalated between parties when searching for a resolution. Where relevant use UML activity diagrams to illustrate information flows and / or decision-making processes._>
