# Organisational Model: <_project name_>

This is the organisational model for the <_project name_> project.

Architecture activity is not undertaken in isolation. For an architecture practice to be effective it must be sympathetic to the work that an organisation undertakes, the processes and tools established to do so, and the existing architecture maturity. In particular, the architecture framework must be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the work that is to be undertaken. This document describes the organisational context within which our architecture work is undertaken in order to provide a canvas against which the architecture practice can be tailored.
