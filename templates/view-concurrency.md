# Concurrency View: <_Project Name_>


## Purpose

The concurrency view describes the concurrency structure of the system and maps functional elements to concurrency units to clearly identify the parts of the system that can execute concurrently and how this is coordinated and controlled.

## System-Level Concurrency Models

<_Create a set of UML diagrams that map the elements of the functional view onto runtime execution entities. The concurrency model will typically include: processes, process groups, threads / thread pools, interprocess communication._>


## State Models

<_Create a set of UML statecharts, one for each of the system's runtime elements, describing the set of states the element can be in, the valid transitions between those states, the events that trigger a transition, as well as any actions fired as a result of a transition. Create a UML diagram that explains the relationship between these state machines—the overall state model. Be careful to only include architecturally relevant details, in order to keep the diagrams comprehensible._>
