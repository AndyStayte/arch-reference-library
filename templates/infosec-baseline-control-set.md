#Information Security Baseline Control Set


## Purpose

The purpose of this baseline control set is to document the security controls implemented, or proposed for implementation, in the project.  The document follows the [ISO 27001](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm) standard and more details on the individual controls found in the [HMG IA Standard Numbers 1 & 2 - Supplement, Technical Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment](https://cesgiap.gsi.gov.uk) document.

## Guidance

**This section provides guidelines on the use of the template that should be removed from the completed document. These guidelines are to help anyone using this template and will allow for the consistant completion across projects.**

- **CESG documents for more detail** – Use the [HMG IA Standard Numbers 1 & 2 - Supplement, Technical Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment](https://cesgiap.gsi.gov.uk) document to obtain more detailed information in respect of the various sections detailed below and to guide how you choose to complete these.
- **Refer to existing** – Where possible use and make reference to existing policies, processes and solutions within Scottish Government such as "Saltire", "Scottish Government security policy", "eRDM", "HR policies", "HR procedures" and "Business impact assessment tool".
- **Reference 3rd party use** – Utilisation of 3rd parties to deliver services is expected for all projects, even another team within the organisation could be considered a 3rd party to the project, so reference must be made to the expectation that these suppliers will manage areas properly in the baseline control set to this and how associated risks are mitigated through controls such as functional/non-functional requirements in procurement mechanisms, contracts with service levels, monitoring of the activities of the 3rd party and recording of the residual risk of a supplier not managing these areas of security properly.
- **Do not omit** – Where a project has not followed best practice it is important that this is documented here and not omitted, justification for this type of deviation can be done be registering the residual risk in the project risk register along with any mitigating controls in place and ultimately the informed acceptance of the risk by the information asset owner.
- **All controls** – Document all controls not just technical ones as processes and procedures are just as important, sometimes more so, in maintaining security.
- **Living document** – During the development of this document there will be a number of unanswered questions so feel free to use markdown bolding to mark these questions in the document so readers understand where the gaps still are.
- **Operating procedures** – This document is not expected to hold all the detail regarding how security is implemented and should make reference to more detail documents such as operating procedures.
