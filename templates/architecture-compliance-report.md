# Architecture Compliance Report


## Purpose

This report summarises the outcome of an architecture compliance review. The purpose of an architecture compliance review is to analyse an architecture against an established set of criteria in order to determine its suitability. It is possible to evaluate a baseline, transition or target architecture for compliance.

Where an architecture is found to be in a status other than "Fully Conformant" this should be captured as a set of dispensations in the dispensation log and appropriate action scheduled to resolve the situation. In some cases it may be possible to accept the non-conformance and record this as a residual risk in the RAID log.

Note that where the architecture is not found to be "Fully Conformant" this may equally be as a result of environmental changes (such as changes to enterprise policy / standards) or as a result of evaluating a transitionary architecture, rather than simply indiscipline in the delivery team.

_[RAID]: Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Decisions._
