### SWAN

| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The Scottish Wide Area Network (SWAN) is a single public services network for the use of all public service organisations within Scotland.

As a priority action of Scotland’s Digital Future: Delivery of Public Services, SWAN is a means by which the public services delivery sector can collaborate across organisational boundaries to ensure that the services delivered – whether at national or local level – can be truly joined up to meet the needs of the users of public services, the citizens and businesses of Scotland.

The SWAN initiative aims to enable infrastructure and service sharing that will produce cost and performance efficiencies and facilitate the creation of public services that are high quality, continually improving, efficient and responsive to local needs.

### Public Sector Colocation Register

| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | Scottish public sector

The Scottish Government provides a [colocation register](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/datahostingdatacentres/pscoloregister) as a part of its activities to support Scottish public sector organisations in realising the [Data Hosting and Data Centre Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Economy/digital/digitalservices/datahostingdatacentres). The register lists public sector organisations who offer colocation services for data hosting.

### PSN

The [PSN](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/public-services-network) is the UK government’s high-performance network, which helps public sector organisations work together, reduce duplication and share resources.

| **Service Class** | Technology
| **Scope**         | UK public sector

The Public Services Network (PSN) is a multi-supplier environment providing end-to-end service assurance for security, integrity and reliability, comprising a network of networks operating at a minimum Business Impact Level of IL2 for Confidentiality and Integrity. The PSN in effect offers the benefits of a competitive multi-vendor market place, but with levels of performance and assurance typically associated with a single-supplier network. PSN suppliers must comply with standards to ensure that this integrity is maintained.

Public sector organisations can access PSN-compliant services over the PSN. A [catalogue of PSN-compliant services](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-services-network-psn-service-compliance) is available, which lists the services currently available and the services in the process of becoming PSN-compliant. Commercial service providers can sell services to public sector organisations on the PSN, but the service must be PSN compliant.

## Ongoing activities

### GDS: Government as a Platform

Government as a Platform is UK Government's new vision for digital government:

> common core infrastructure of shared digital systems, technology and processes on which it’s easy to build brilliant, user-centric government services.

GDS have identified that siloed approaches to transformation don’t work and that 'reinventing the wheel' every time the public sector builds a service has led to duplication and waste. Based on their investigations they believe that there are around thirty foundational capabilities that, if they existed and could be re-used, would radically change the speed and cost of building new services.

To test this GDS are building a range of common services that are used all around government. These services can then be interconnected to form larger systems or full services. GDS expects that with shared components delivering common capabilities, service teams can focus solely on building what their service needs to do. GDS also plans to build this component suite using open standards to ensure that it isn't closed or locked away inside a proprietary stack of technology and processes.

GDS believes that GAAP will make it quicker and cheaper to build new services meaning that citizens and businesses will get more services, of a higher quality, and for less money than before.

The following services are currently being developed as a a part of GAAP:

- [Gov.uk Pay](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/23/making-payments-more-convenient-and-efficient/)
- [Gov.uk Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify)
- [Gov.uk Notify](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/01/06/introducing-notify/)

In support of the GAAP GDS are also building a general purpose [platform to host digital services](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/08/building-a-platform-to-host-digital-services/) based on [Cloud Foundry](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/). The service is currently in [beta](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/24/hosting-digital-services-beta/).
