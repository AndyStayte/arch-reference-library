# Hosting

The deployment of physical ICT assets has evolved dramatically in recent years. Critical business applications require high availability which can best be delivered through modern datacenters. The capital and revenue expenditure required to build and maintain a modern datacenter or to purchase, support and refresh hardware in a co-location facility is unlikely to be justified given the range of established hosting providers available. When determining the infrastructure strategy the following hosting models should be considered.


## Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)

In the last several years Infrastructure as a Service has become a common approach to managing hosting and infrastructure requirements. This tends to involve a capability to rapidly add or remove capacity, often in minutes, and to be billed only for what is used. This provides a great deal of flexibility and the ability to hold costs down but also requires a degree of technical skill to manage.


## Platform as a Service (PAAS)

Similar to Infrastructure as a Service above, Platform as a Service offerings tend to allow for quickly adding or removing capacity and sophisticated pay-on-demand pricing. The difference is that you are abstracted away from the underlying infrastructure completely. The unit here is the running application, not a virtual or physical machine. Using a platform as a service places a number of constraints on the software architecture but can move the support burden for parts of the stack onto the supplier.


## Selection Criteria

Having selected a suitable operating model, there are a number of factors to be considered in the selection of a hosting provider, namely:

- technical requirements of your software applications;
- future capacity requirements;
- user support;
- reilience and redundancy;
- mandated government information security requirements;
- government network connectivity;
- cost of service;
- flexibility and on-demand billing;
- different operating models, as detailed above.

In addition to the criteria above the datacenter should meet the classification of tier 4, namely

-   All components should be fully redundant
-   Multiple, independent distribution paths service all IT equipment
-   All equipment must be dual powered
-   All cooling equipment is independently dual-powered, including
    chillers and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC)
    systems
-   Fault-tolerant site infrastructure with electrical power storage and
    distribution facilities

Such a configuration is capable of providing 99.995% availability in normal operation but the datacentre is still a single point of failure. To add resilience and provide contingency in the event of a disaster it would be preferable to select a provider with datacentres in geographically distant locations. This facility is available from a number of providers of hosted solutions.

To allow for the requirements of availability, resilience, elasticity and scalability, the infrastructure should be virtualised as far as possible.
