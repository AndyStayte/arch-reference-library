The system quality specification documents the current best understanding of the warranty expected from system stakeholders. See the divisional system quality reference model for more information._>


## Benefits Map

<_Catalogue the benefits that the project aims to deliver and provide a description of how the target architecture will realise the stated benefits._>


## Architecture Method

<_Provide a brief description of the architecture method that will be used. Explain how this method will be integrated with the overall project / programme delivery method._>
