# Design Pattern: <_Pattern Name_>

<!--

How do we describe design patterns? Graphical notations, while important and useful, aren’t sufficient. They simply capture the end product of the design process as relationships between classes and objects. To reuse the design, we must also record the decisions, alternatives, and trade-offs that led to it. Concrete examples are important too, because they help you see the design in action.

We describe design patterns using a consistent format. Each pattern is divided into sections according to the following template. The template lends a uniform structure to the information, making design patterns easier to learn, compare, and use.

Please note this template is extracted from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides.

## Pattern Name and Classification

<_The pattern's name conveys the essence of the pattern succinctly. A good name is vital, because it will become part of your design vocabulary._>


## Intent

<_A short statement that answers the following questions: What does the design pattern do? What is its rationale and intent? What particular design issue or problem does it address?_>


## Also Known As

<_Other well-known names for the pattern, if any._>


## Motivation

<_A scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the class and object structures in the pattern solve the problem. The scenario will help you understand the more abstract description of the pattern that follows._>


## Applicability

<_What are the situations in which the design pattern can be applied? What are examples of poor designs that the pattern can address? How can you recognize these situations?_>


## Structure

<_A graphical representation of the classes in the pattern using UML. If relevant, also use interaction diagrams to illustrate sequences of requests and collaborations between objects._>


## Participants

<_The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their responsibilities._>


## Collaborations

<_How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities._>


## Consequences

<_How does the pattern support its objectives? What are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern? What aspect of system structure does it let you vary independently?_>


## Implementation

<_What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be aware of when implementing the pattern? Are there language-specific issues?_>


## Sample Code

<_Code fragments that illustrate how you might implement the pattern in C# or Java._>


## Known Uses

<_Examples of the pattern found in real systems. If possible, include at least two examples from different domains._>


## Related Patterns

<_What design patterns are closely related to this one? What are the important differences? With which other patterns should this one be used?_>
