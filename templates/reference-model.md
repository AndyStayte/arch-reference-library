# Reference Model: <_Subject_>


## Purpose

An architecture reference model is an abstract framework or domain-specific ontology consisting of an interlinked set of clearly defined concepts produced by an expert or body of experts in order to encourage clear communication. This frame of reference can then be used to communicate ideas clearly among members of the architecture and/or delivery community.
