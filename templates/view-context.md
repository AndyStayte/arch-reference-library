## Context Model

<_Use UML notation to describe how the system fits within the broader enterprise environment. In particular, describe how the system relates to external entities, including the nature and characteristics of those interactions._>


## Interaction Scenarios

<_Model key interactions (e.g. those that are complicated, contentious or poorly understood) between the system and external entities in more detail. Keep the number of scenarios you document manageable—typically around 15 is sufficient._>
