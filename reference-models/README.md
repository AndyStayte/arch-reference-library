# Reference Models

This folder contains a range of reference models that describe various aspects of the delivery of digital public services. Together these models begin to form a reference architecture for the delivery of digital public services.

The objectives of this reference architecture are:

- provide a tool for communication and common understanding of policies and guidance and good-to-best practice capabilities required to design and operate digital services;
- support baselining against an organisation's existing digital services;
- support strategy definition for future state architecture.
