## Executive Summary

<_Summarise the findings from stakeholder mapping. In particular, highlight the key players._>


## Identification & Analysis

<_Brainstorm the stakeholders of the architecture. Avoid concentrating too strongly on the formal structure of the organisation – you can use the [stakeholder concerns](#typicalstakeholderconcerns) table in the appendices as an aide. Classify each identified stakeholder considering their understanding of the architecture, commitment to the project/programme, etc._>

| Name | Stakeholder Group | Proxy? | Authorised? | Representative? | Ability to Disrupt Change | Current Under­standing | Required Under­standing | Current Commit­ment | Required Commit­ment | Required Support

See [appendix](#stakeholderclassifications) for column definitions.


## Management Approach

<_For each stakeholder consider the power they have to advance or block the architecture. Also, consider the level of interest they have in the architecture. Using the [stakeholder power grid](#stakeholderpowergrid) in the appendices determine the appropriate management approach._>

## Engagement Deliverables

<_Based on the previous stakeholder analysis and determined management approach consider the architectural artefacts that will be most suitable when engaging with each identified stakeholder group._>

## Appendices

### Stakeholder classifications

Informed (Understanding)
: Do your stakeholders have the information, the experience, and the understanding needed to make the right decisions?

Proxy
: Is your stakeholder an individual who speaks for the concerns of the real stakeholder group without themselves being a member.

Committed
: Are your stakeholders willing and able to make themselves available to participate in the process, and are they prepared to make some possibly difficult decisions?

Authorised
: Can you be sure that decisions made now by your stakeholders will not be reversed later (at potentially high cost)?

Representative
: If a stakeholder is a group rather than a person, have suitable representatives been selected from the group? Do those representatives meet the criteria for individual stakeholders?

### Stakeholder Power Grid

|                 |                     |                    |
| ---             | ---                 | ---                |
| Power: **HIGH** | Keep Satisfied (KS) | Key Players (KP)   |
| Power: **LOW**  | Minimal Effort (ME) | Keep Informed (KI) |
|                 | Interest: **LOW**   | Interest: **HIGH** |

### Typical Stakeholder Concerns

| Stakeholder | Key Concerns
| ---         | ---
| CxO (Corporate Functions); e.g., CEO, CFO, CIO, COO | The high-level drivers, goals, and objectives of the organisation, and how these are translated into an effective process and IT architecture to advance the business.
| Program Management Office (Corporate Functions); e.g., Project Portfolio Managers | Prioritising, funding, and aligning change activity. An understanding of project content and technical dependencies between projects supports portfolio management decision-making.
| Procurement (Corporate Functions); e.g., Acquirers | Understanding what building blocks of the architecture can be bought, and what constraints (or rules) are relevant to the purchase. Acquirers will shop with multiple vendors looking for the best cost solution while adhering to the constraints (or rules) derived from the architecture, such as standards. The key concern is to make purchasing decisions that fit the architecture.
| Human Resources (HR) (Corporate Functions); e.g., HR Managers, Training & Development Managers | The roles and actors are required to support the architecture and changes to it. The key concern is managing people transitions.
| Enterprise Security (Corporate Functions); e.g., Corporate Risk Management, Security Officers, IT Security Managers | Ensuring that the information, data, and systems of the organisation are available to only those that have permission, and protecting the information, data, and systems from unauthorised tampering.
| QA/Standards Group (Corporate Functions); e.g., Data Owners, Process Owners, Technical Standards Bodies | Ensuring the consistent governance of the organisation’s business, data, application, and technology assets.
| Executive (End User Organisation); e.g., Business Unit Directors, Business Unit CxOs, Business Unit Head of IT/Architecture | The high-level drivers, goals, and objectives of the organisation, and how these are translated into an effective process and architecture to advance the business.
| Line Management (End User Organisation); e.g., Senior Business Managers, Operations Regional Managers, IT Managers | Top-level functions and processes of the organisation, and how the key applications support these processes.
| Business Domain Experts (End User Organisation); e.g., Business Process Experts, Business/Process Analyst, Process Architect, Process Designer, Functional Managers, Business Analyst | Functional aspects of processes and supporting systems. This can cover the human actors involved in the system, the user processes involved in the system, the functions required to support the processes, and the information required to flow in support of the processes.
| IT Service Management (Systems Operations); e.g., Service Delivery Manager | Ensuring that IT services provided to the organisation meet the service levels required by that organisation to succeed in business.
| IT Operations — Applications (System Operations); e.g., Application Architecture, System & Software Engineers | Development approach, software modularity and re- use, portability migration, and interoperability.
| IT Operations — Infrastructure (System Operations); e.g., Infrastructure Architect, Wintel support, Mid-range support, Operational DBA, Service Desk | Location, modifiability, re- usability, and availability of all components of the system. Ensuring that the appropriate components are developed and deployed within the system in an optimal manner.
| IT Operations — Data/Voice Communications (System Operations); e.g., Network Management | Location, modifiability, re- usability, and availability of communications and networking services. Ensuring that the appropriate communications and networking services are developed and deployed within the system in an optimal manner.
| Executive (Project Organisation); e.g., Sponsor, Program Manager | On-time, on-budget delivery of a change initiative that will realise expected benefits for the organisation.
| Line Management (Project Organisation); e.g., Project Manager | Operationally achieving on- time, on-budget delivery of a change initiative with an agreed scope.
| Business Process/Functional Expert (Project Organisation); e.g., Financials FICO Functional Consultant, HR Functional Consultant | Adding more detail to the functional requirements of a change initiative based on experience and interaction with business domain experts in the end-user organisation.
| Product Specialist (Project Organisation); e.g., Portal Product Specialist | Specifying technology product designs in order to meet project requirements and comply with the Architecture Vision of the solution. In a packages and packaged services environment, product expertise can be used to identify product capabilities that can be readily leveraged and can provide guidance on strategies for product customisation.
| Technical Specialist (Project Organisation); e.g., Application Architect | Specifying technology product designs in order to meet project requirements and comply with the Architecture Vision of the solution.
| Regulatory Bodies (Outside Services); e.g., Financial Regulator, Industry Regulator | Receipt of the information they need in order to regulate the client organisation, and ensuring that their information requirements are properly satisfied.
