## Quality Attributes

The table below specifies the quality attributes for the system. The requirements are listed in priority order, highest to lowest. Where the system design requires a trade off between two quality attributes the highest priority requirement should take precedence.

| Attribute | Requirement | KPI | Target
| ---       | ---         | --- | ---
| …         | …           | …   | …

For example:
