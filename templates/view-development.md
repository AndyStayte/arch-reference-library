## Module Structure Models

<_Using UML produce one or more component diagrams that illustrate how the system's source code is organised into packages, modules, and application tiers / layers. If relevant define and document interlayer dependency rules. Provide one model for each application process (e.g. a client-server or micro-services architecture)._>


## Common Design Models

<_Document design constraints and common approaches that will apply when architecting and realising the system._>

### Common Design Model: <_Element Name_>

#### Design element

<_Describe the element of the solution for which a common approach is required (e.g. logging, internationalisation or database access)._>

#### Agreed approach
<_Describe the standard approach that has been agreed for the design element. Also include an explanation of where this approach is applicable and why it is the preferred approach. If necessary include one or more UML diagrams to illustrate the approach._>

#### Technology solution

<_Describe any third-party software or libraries that will form part of the solution_>.


## Code-line Models

<_Summarise the development practices that you will use to ensure a predictable, sustainable & adaptive delivery process. In particular, consider version control, testing, configuration management, build management & release management._>
